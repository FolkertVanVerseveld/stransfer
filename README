Simple to use serpent encrypted file transferring program. Files can be sent
from both ends. The maximum file size is theoretically 2^64-1, but most file
systems do not support files of this size.

You need a POSIX compliant system with bash and gcc to compile the program.
Just run: ./configure_debug && make

Note that the password is provided as an option which you can grab from the
command history. The simplest way to prevent this is to start the command in a
shell script and call the script.
E.g.:
$ cat test.sh
#!/bin/sh
./transfer -s -k test some_file
$ ./test.sh
